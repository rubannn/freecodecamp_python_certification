### 1. Build a User Configuration Manager
In this lab, you will build a User Configuration Manager that allows users to manage their settings such as theme, language, and notifications. You will implement functions to add, update, delete, and view user settings.

### 2. Build a Budget App
In this lab, you will build a simple budget app that tracks spending in different categories and can show the relative spending percentage on a graph.

### 3. Build a Polygon Area Calculator
In this project, you will use object-oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit its methods and attributes.


### 4. Build a Hash Table
In this lab, you will build a hash table from scratch. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. A hash table works by taking the key as an input and then hashing this key according to a specific hashing function.

For the purpose of this lab, the hashing function will be simple: it will sum the Unicode values of each character in the key. The hash value will then be used as the actual key to store the associated value. The same hash value would also be used to retrieve and delete the value associated with the key.


### 5. Implement the Tower of Hanoi Algorithm
In this lab, you will solve the mathematical puzzle known as the Tower of Hanoi. The puzzle consists of three rods and a number of disks of different diameters.
